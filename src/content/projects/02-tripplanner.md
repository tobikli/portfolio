During the Intro Course at the iPraktikum 2024/25 at TUM, I developed a Swift App that lets the user track, budget and plan trips and vacations. Users can input their budget and how much they spend, as well as flights, hotels, food and activities. The budget is shown in several statistics. Furthermore it features a Map of the city of the trip as well as live Weather via API calls.
