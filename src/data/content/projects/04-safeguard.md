During my Bachelor Praktikum at TUM, I participated at the renowned iPraktikum in WS24. Together with SIEMENS as a Client, me and my team created a Real-Time EHS App for iOS, informing workers and guests about upcoming hazards in Siemens factories. Some notable features include:
App Clip Support,
Live Activity Support,
Supabase Backend,
Industrial Edge Connection,
MQTT Protocol
