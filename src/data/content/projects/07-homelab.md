During my Working Student Position at Siemens, I found passion in building and hosting my own services, especially regarding Virtualization and Clustering.
Currently, I have a own Proxmox machine running several services in a fenced of internal network. These include my own cloud storage, VPN, several services like Paperless and also this website. Homelabbing taught me many things regarding Networking, System Administration and architecture. You can get access to the Server using the link below.
